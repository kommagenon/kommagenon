Hello Internet,

My name is Borna. In 2022 I completed my B.A. studies in Political Science and World Politics in Russia.
Now better understanding the threat and state of anarchy in the world, I aspire to contribute in building solutions that secure sociopolitical order, without damanging democratic institutions.
Ironic I say this being a Russian, but oh well...


Wear your seatbelts.
