Hello Internet,

My name is Borna. In 2022 I completed my B.A. studies in Political Science and World Politics in Russia.
Now better understanding the threat and state of anarchy in the world, I aspire to contribute in building solutions that secure sociopolitical order, without damanging democratic institutions.
Ironic I say this being a Russian, but oh well...

I'm already versed in JS â€“ but will focus on Fullstack dev.
Then I'm shifting my focus on Solidty and Rust.

Am I about to launch a new NFT series?... No. I'm not a ************** 

Wear your seatbelts.
